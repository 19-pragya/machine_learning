WHAT IS LINEAR REGRESSION?

Linear regression is a form of predictable modelling which builds a relationship between input variables and output variable
its used to predict the output as continuous values


A line of regression shows the linear relationship between independent variable and dependent variable

note
input variables are independent variables 
and dependent variables are output variable



SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

It is used when we have more than one inputs 
                                      y = b0 + b1x1
                                      
MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

It is used when we have more than one output variable
                                     y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ......
                                     
                                     
LOSS FUCNTION IN LINEAR REGRESSION

MEAN SQUARED FUNCTION (MSE)  is the most commonly used function in regression
MSE is the sum of squared distances between our target variable and predicted values then divided by no. of samples

TECHNIQUES TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL
  R- SQUARED
        this is the statistical measure of how close the data are to be fitted the regression line
        best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (worst model)
